# HOW TO: Introduction to Internationalization (i18n) in Java Standard Edition (JS2E)

The internatinoalization (i18n) approach in Java, as opposed to more recent technologgies, is somewhat less console-dependant.

While other programming languages have developed console-driven modules and plug-ins to handle specific parts of the i18n circle, Java requires implementing in our application code the language's "Internationalization API" classes.

J2SE i18n's API holds classes to handle:

- [Text isolation (In progress)](/assets/java/text_isolation/README.md)
- [Dates (To be done)](/assets/java/dates/README.md)
- [Currency (To be done)](/assets/java/currency/README.md)
- [Pluralization (To be done)](/assets/java/pluralization/README.md)
