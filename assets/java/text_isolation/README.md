# HOW TO: Text isolation (text extraction)

Isolating text is probably the core approach in multilingual software as it enables software to be language-independant.

Harcoded strings might benefit during the very early stages of software development. However, the sooner **text isolation** techniques are implemented, the more efficient both i18n and l10n approaches will be.

Class **ResourceBundle** is J2SE Internationalization API's main class for text isolation.
