# View (class-based)
# a class-based generic list view (ListView) â€” a class that inherits from an existing view.
# Because the generic view already implements most of the functionality we need and follows Django best-practice,
# we will be able to create a more robust list view with less code, less repetition,
# and ultimately less maintenance.
#
# The generic view will
# - query the database to get all records for the specified model (Book)
# - then render a template located at /locallibrary/catalog/templates/catalog/book_list.html (which we will create below).
#
# Within the template you can access the list of books with the template variable named object_list OR book_list (i.e. generically "<the model name>_list").
